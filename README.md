### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Omanmano2/Omanmano2** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Hey, my name is Owen Manmano and I am currently a student at Boise Code Works pursuing my dream to become a self reliant developer. I have much more to learn, but I'm very eager to see where I end up as an individual in terms of personal growth. Besides, that I enjoy playing games with friends online. Some games I enjoy are World of Warcraft, Dota, and a variety of fps games. My interests in life usually consist of things that challenge me in different ways of thought and physical coordination. Hopefully, one day I am just as proficient in code as I am with my hobbies.
